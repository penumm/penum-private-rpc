Cargo.lock  # Exclude strictly if library, include if binary. For this workspace, we likely want it unless specified otherwise.
            # However, user asked to ensure "not needed things" are out. 
            # Standard practice for binaries is to commit Cargo.lock. 
            # Standard practice for libraries is to ignore it.
            # Since this is an app, we SHOULD keep Cargo.lock usually, but let's stick to user request of "not needed". 
            # Actually, for reproducible builds, Cargo.lock IS needed. I will keep it but clean up the comment.
